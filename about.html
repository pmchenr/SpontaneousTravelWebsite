            <p>
                I am passionate about seeing the world as a local would and 
                making an impact through my work. 
            </p>

            <h3>Travel</h3>
            <p>
                My mom was a flight attendant for US Air so I grew up with the perk of free standby flights. 
                While having free flights anywhere in the world, we never made it internationally until I was 16.  
                We got to see the entire east coast of the US on roadtrips, the beautiful rocky montains of Colorado to ski,
                and grew up on Siesta Key Beach in Florida. My first trip internationally was to Matagalpa, Nicaragua on a
                mission trip with my church. The first night consisted of splitting up into pairs and living with a local for a night or two. 
                From here, I was hooked. I then made a trip to Europe during my senior year of high school. I have now been back several times
                and have been to 14 different countries on 2 continents. I am going to Tanzania to make it 3 continents for my 
                honeymoon.  I don't necesarily want to make it a task to check off as many countries as possible, but more of 
                a goal to see the world.  We live on the planet, so why can't we see it all? It isn't just for the rich and famous.
                Why not me?
            </p>
            <h3>Work</h3>
            <p>
                I still don't know exactly what I want to do for work. I challenged myself in school to always take the 
                most challenging classes. I majored in Engineering partly because my dad wanted me to and partly because
                I thought the difficulty of it would gain respect and pay well.  I never really challenged myself to figure 
                out what I wanted to do.  I ended up picking the major that will lead to me working in and around manufacturing
                plants my entire career. After my first job in a truck plant, I realized it was not for me.  I started to really
                dive into what I wanted to get out of my work.  There were 3 things that stood out. 1. I want change the world for the better.
                2. I want to be able to work from anywhere in the world so I can continue to see it. 3. I want to continue to learn so 
                that I can keep up with current technology and stay young. This is why I am currently learning to become a software developer.
                It checks every box for me.
